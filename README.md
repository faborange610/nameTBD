## Overview
### Description
This app is used to look for events/free stuff on campus.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social/Shopping
- **Mobile:** Usage of map, camera, & location
- **Story:** This app would be very convenient and easy to use for UCSD students because it would put all events and free stuff near UCSD into a single app, and there's also a map for students to look at if they want to know where the events are.
- **Market:** UCSD students, and could be applied to a bigger scale in the future.
- **Habit:** Users would check often (once a day or more) to see if there are new events/free stuff. Users could also make new posts to notify others.
- **Scope:** The app started as a way to find events/free stuff on a map. It expanded to include taking images of the event or items and making your own post.
